*The Price of Salt*, written in 1952 by Patricia Highsmith under the pseudonym Claire Morgan is a romance novel that follows the story of Therese, an aspiring stage designer in New York who falls in love with Carol, a housewife in the middle of a divorce and vicious battle over the custody of her daughter. What ensues is a tale of finding oneself, the complicated matter of love and a heart-breaking observation of the social attitudes towards same-sex relationships at that time. The book has since been republished as *Carol* as well as being adapted into a movie in 2015 and published as an ebook and audiobook. The repeated republishing of hard copies since 1952 has inevitably resulted in a plethora of book covers, all of which brandish different typefaces that reflect attitudes towards the book and its themes over time.
