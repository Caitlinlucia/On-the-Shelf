Autobiographies have long been used by public figures as a way of documenting their journey to the limelight, important moments in their lives or their careers. Whether ghost-written or self-written, writing an autobiography or memoir seems to have become a rite of passage for public figures; from the memoirs of politicians such as Margaret Thatcher (former UK Prime Minister from 1979-1990) to the juicy tell-alls of reality stars such as Erika Jayne (Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star from 2015-present), they seem a popular source of income for both the public figure and the publisher. Of course, the tone of a political memoir would be vastly different from a reality star's, and this is where typography and cover design comes in.
