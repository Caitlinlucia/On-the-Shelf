Dystopian novels have been a relatively popular genre of fiction since the early 1900s; with *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin acclaimed as the first dystopian novel. More well known titles within the genre include *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury, *1984* by George Orwell and the more recent series *The Hunger Games* Suzanne Collins. Most dystopian novels feature a totalitarian or authoritarian society that oppresses one or many groups within that society. The authorities within such plots tend to rule through extreme invasions of privacy and control via methods not dissimilar to things that are already seen within societies around the world now; collection of individuals' technological data, policing of women's bodies and withholding/banning of information that could sway people's opinions against those in power - those who are anti-establishment are punished.
