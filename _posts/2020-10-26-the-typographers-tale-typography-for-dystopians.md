Dystopian novels have been a relatively popular genre of fiction since the early 1900s; with *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin acclaimed as the first dystopian novel. More well-known titles within the genre include *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury, *Nineteen Eighty-Four* by George Orwell and the more recent series *The Hunger Games* by Suzanne Collins. Most dystopian novels feature a totalitarian or authoritarian society that oppresses one or many groups within that society. The authorities within such plots tend to rule through extreme invasions of privacy and control via methods not dissimilar to things that are already seen within societies around the world now; collection of individuals' technological data, policing of women's bodies and withholding/banning information that could sway people's opinions against those in power - those who are anti-establishment are punished. As with all literature, the designs and typography for dystopian book covers has changed somewhat since the earlier novels within the genre. As society and politics has changed and technology has developed into an increasingly bigger part of our lives dystopian plots have changed focus slightly, and the designs for their covers have altered accordingly.

## Nineteen Eighty-Four

George Orwell's 1949 novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four* follows the story of a secretly anti-establishment rank-and-file worker and member of the Party (the authority in power) in an imagined futuristic Europe that is held under a Stalinesque totalitarian state. There isn't much room within the book's societal regime for personal choice and individuality, and this is very much reflected in the first edition's front cover. Text stating the name of the book and the authorship covers the expanse of the front design, leaving no room for images or additional text, much like the restrictive nature of the plot's setting. There is also a rigid structure to the text; centrally aligned and in straight lines that go from the left margin to the right, yet there is a layering of the book's title with 1984 written in both numerical and alphabetical form. This throws into question the true form of the title, just as the protagonist of the book questions the system - does Big Brother really exist? Is there a way out of this society?

This representation is furthered through the typefaces of the cover. The first font used is a bold, cursive typeface for the front layer of text displaying the authorship and alphabetical title of the book. The easy flowing style of the typeface is similar to the almost utopian nature of society that dystopian states often try to brainwash their citizens into believing is real; a front or a mirage that hides the atrocities committed behind the screen. Meanwhile the second font (which is used for the background layer of text for the numerical version of the title) is around five times bigger and a bold, lightly serifed font. The typeface combined with the military green background is reminiscent of war propaganda, presenting a sense of warning, danger and conflict that matches the plot's setting in a war-ridden Europe controlled through lies and manipulation that provide a mask of harmony.
