Recipe books may not be works of literature recounting tales of bravery or revolving around a tumultuous romantic relationship but they are still incredibly popular despite the current digital age of free online recipes. Recipe books are thought to have been published and sold commercially since the 4th century onwards (*Culinary Matters* by a Roman man called Apicius being one of the earliest recorded), though recipes have been recorded for personal use since long Before Christ. One of the most well known historical recipe books is *Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management*. Originally published in 1861and still in print today, it covered everything from cooking meals and preparing sauces and jams to organising the household's taxes. Modern recipe books no longer cover such a wide range of housekeeping, particularly because the role of housekeeping and indeed cooking is no longer constrained to the women of the house or its staff. Cookbooks are now often aimed at specific age or economic groups, or cover a specific type of food such as vegetarian meals. Cooking is also considered not just as a profession or necessity now, but also a hobby ands so the design of recipe book covers has become much more important in aiming to catch a browsing buyer's eye. 

The two recipe books I will be looking at are aimed at entirely different demographics; *The Adventurous Eater's Club* by Misha and Vicki Collins is a celebrity cookbook aimed at encouraging cooking as a family activity, while *The Hungry Student One Pot Cookbook* is (as its title suggests) aimed at students living alone who want to make simple but nutritious meals that require minimal washing up.
