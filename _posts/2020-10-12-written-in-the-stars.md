Spirituality literature covers a wide range of subjects, from religion to crystal work to astrology. However, given the fact that spiritualities are based largely on a set of beliefs rather than proven facts, such subjects are not considered science. This means that while geology (the study of rocks) is considered a science, crystal healing (the practise of using crystal 'chakra' or energy to heal or channel certain energies) is not. Similarly, astronomy (the study of the planets and stars) is considered a science but astrology (the practice of using planetary movements to determine and predict outcomes and behaviours) is considered to be more of a spiritual study. This naturally means that such topics are written as entirely different genres, and so the designs of their book covers tend to differ quite a lot.
