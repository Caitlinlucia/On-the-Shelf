Hello! 

If you have somehow found your way to my blog then I imagine that you, like me, have an interest in either book design, typography or both. Each week I plan to post at least one blog post on the typography of book covers; whether it be of one genre, comparing two genres or analysing the design of one specific book cover, I aim to look at what allows us to judge a book by its cover and why.
